## **Wynk Clone: A Music Player App**

### **Project Overview**
This project is a clone of the popular music streaming platform, Wynk. It's a breakthrough project for me as it's the first time I've built a large-scale project without following any tutorials. Despite some code repetition and unconventional file structure, this project has been a great learning experience.
